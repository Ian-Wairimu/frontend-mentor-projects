## My process

I started by opening the design in Adobe Photoshop. I began to break the design down into seperate components.

1. 'outer-container' to center the card component on the page

2. 'card-container' to contain all of the cards elements.

I used yellow / blue boxes so that I could easily visualise the design layout.

I then decided to CSS Grid to control the positioning of the card compenent and it's elements.
